# hello-world

I am a Psychology PhD Candidate with a Concentration in Quantitative Psychology at the University of Miami. My main resesarch focus is in evolutionary social psychology but I am also dedicated to improving my statistical and programming skills. I hope to share some resources here that I've created to help my students with conducting analyses in R.
